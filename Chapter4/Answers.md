Ex4.1

The value of the pair (11, down) is -1 under random policy since the next state is the terminal state. To get the value for the pair (7, down), we need to use the value of the states and get -15.  

Ex4.2

When the original transition is unchanged, there is no way to get to the new state 15, so the value functions of original states remain unaltered. So we get the value for the new state 15 is -20.  
Well, after solving the vlue functions with Ex4.2.py, I find the  value of the new state is still -20, equal to the value for original state 13. This is an understanbale concidence. So when the state 13 choose the down actions, it get the same value as itself and thus couldn't feel the new state in terms of the value functions.
