Ex2.1  
The cumlative rewards are shown in the figure 3 generated by the Ex2.1.py. But I could not understand what the cumlative probability means. Cumlative probability should have some kind of probability distribution. I think the optimal action has included the best action before the step and calculate the probability then, which is not the probability distribution.

Ex2.2
The former rewards, the less weights. Too obvious to be true.
