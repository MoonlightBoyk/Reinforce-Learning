The estimated jump up for last two rows in the rear because when the player sum is 20 or 21, he sticks to avood going bust and he is highly possible to win the game then. It dropes pff the whole last row in the left becuase of A in the dealer cards. A in the dealer cards meaning smaller porbability to go bust due to two numbers of A and greater probability to have 21 since any face is 10. So dealer is more likely to win. The upper diagrams have higher values since usable A has two ways described above to increase the probability to win.
