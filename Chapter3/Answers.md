I think the line between the agent and environment depends on the specific circumstance. When we are learning how to drive, we should focus on the accelerators, brake and so on. Neither want we want to go or the torque from the rubber counts. For a car racer, the tire torque really matter since it counld influence the speed of the car greatly. And for veteran drivers, they konw their car very well and are unnecessary to worry about the detailed acceleration and brake since driving has been something like instant for them. So, say if they want to save the petrol, they should decide the route for the day.  
I think these locations vary in trems of the abstract level. The brain decision is more abstract than the body meeting the machine since there are many other ways to reach the location like the public transit. And there are many different combinations of acceleration and brake to exert the same tire torque on the road. These locations should match the abstract level we concern I think.

The ruturn wuold be ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\gamma^k) , k is the number of time steps before failure. But the continuing formulation will contain other episodes and the k on the exponent in future episodes would take the time step in the former episodes into account. I am confused. Since the rewards would be given after each epsisodes. Why there is a reward associated with each time step in the episodic view?
